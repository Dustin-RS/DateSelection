# DateSelection third level
Date selection third level based on react and typescript, although this app was written on js.

## Installation
Firstly, you need to clone it

git clone https://github.com/Dustin-RS/DateSelection.git
```
Secondly, do following comands
```bash
cd DateSelection
git checkout third_level
cd test-app
```
Then you need to use npm commands, that's why make sure that the **node.js is installed on your computer**.
We need to install modules in order to work with react.
```bash
npm install react-scripts --save
npm start
